I listed some useful links in practise.
<h3> Suggestions to Undergraduate student</h3>
<p> <a href="https://www.zhangjy9610.me/USTCdata.html">USTC Course Schedule Guide</a>. This is a set of course learning suggestions voluntarily compiled by graduates from the undergraduate mathematics program at USTC. Written in Chinese, it remains valuable to this day, even though the students' perspectives are somewhat limited.
<h3> Suggestions to Graduate student</h3>
<p> <a href="https://masataka123.github.io/blog3/pdf/20251001_masterguide/master_guide_20251001_C2.pdf">教科書一覧</a>. I found this document on Professor Iwai's lab homepage. I think it could be extremely useful for graduate students interested in the intersection of several complex variables, complex geometry, and algebraic geometry. The only catch is that it's written in Japanese.

<h3> Illegal links to get published books or papers </h3>
<p> <a href="https://libgen.vg/">Library Genesis</a>
<p> <a href="https://www.sci-hub.pub/">Sci-hub.</a> 
  Although I always try to obtain research literature through legitimate channels, university libraries often lack access to certain publishers. 
  For instance, the University of Science and Technology of China does not have a subscription to download articles from the Proceedings of the AMS. 
  It is also worth noting that for the Journal of Algebraic Geometry, papers published before 1992 are not available online and must be obtained as physical copies through the library.
