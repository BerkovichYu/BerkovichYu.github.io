<h2>Shiyu Zhang</h2>
<p>
  My name in Chinese: 张世宇
<p>
  Email: shiyu123@mail.ustc.edu.cn
<p>
  I was born in 1999. Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) under the supervision of Professor Xi Zhang, where I completed my B.S. in June 2020.
<p>  
 My research primarily focuses on complex geometry. My knowledge is limited and I'm just learning as I go. Recently, I am interested in the generalized Kawamata–Viehweg vanishing theorem, the nonabelian Hodge correspondence and Miyaoka's iequality.

<p>Based on the ideas developed in the previous paper [2], we can establish the structure theorems for partially semi-positive curvature conditions.
  One of the most intriguing implications of this paper is the Hacon-M^ckernan's type question for k-semi-positive Ricci curvature.
  Of independent interests, we confirm a question of Ni that a compact K\"ahler manifolds with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature is rationally connected.</p>

<p> We extend the classical Miyaoka-Yau inequality to all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces.
  One key is the existence of orbifold modification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273">Ou</a> for klt spaces.
  Our argument is indeed new even for the smooth case.</p>

<p> The main result is the establishment of a "pseudoeffective" version of Bochner-type theorem, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle.
  This is a key step of the structure theorems of HSC≥0 for the Kahler case obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367">Professor S. Matsumura</a> recently.</p>
