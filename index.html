  <summary> [7] <span> Non-abelian Hodge corrrespondence over singular K\"ahler spaces, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13071">with Chuanjing Zhang and Xi Zhang, arxiv preprint:2601.12071</a>. </span> </summary>
<p> 
  In this paper, we establish the nonabelian Hodge correspondence over compact K\"ahler klt spaces as well as their regular loci, thereby generalizing the previous result of Greb-Kebekus-Peternell-Taji for projective klt varieties.
</p>
<p>
  As an interesting application, we prove that if a projective klt variety with big canonical divisor satisfies the orbifold Miyaoka-Yau type equality in the sense of the previous work [5] joint with M. Iwai and S. Jinnouchi, then its canonical model must be a singular quotient of the unit ball. 
  See also Jinnouchi's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24161"> recent preprint</a> for K-stable klt varieties with big anti-canonical divisor. 
  Toghther, these results confirm the Miyaoka-Yau inequality formulated via non-pluripolar product developed in the paper [5] provide an effective criterion for projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor.

<p>
  This is just a note, I present an improvement on a result by Chu, Lee, and Tam based on a use of Gauss-Codazzi equation. 
</p> 
<p>
  An example of a projective manifold with ample canonical bundle admits an embedding of P^k was claimed in a paper by Li, L. Ni, and Zhu, this was in fact a typographical error. Thank Lei Ni for kind clarification.
</>
  If someone find such an example, it will be nice because it means that the study on negative k-Ricci curvature indeed provide new perspectives than negative holomorphic sectional curvature. I am not good at construting an example.

  <summary> [5] <span> Miyaoka-Yau inequality for singular varieties with big canonical or anticanonical divisor. with <a href="https://masataka123.github.io/blog3_e/">Masataka Iwai</a> and Satoshi Jinnouchi, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08522">arxiv preprint:2507.08522v2</a>. </span> </summary>
<p> The main result is establishing the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor.
  The basic idea is proving Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality using the non-pluripolar product of <K_X>^{n-2} and providing a proof in the smooth case comes from Iwai and Jinnouchi. 
  When I discussed with M. Iwai how to extend it to the klt case, I contributed this work. 
</p>
<p>
  A basic question is characterizing the equality case of Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality. It's subtle because we used the limiting process in the proof.

  <summary> [4] <span> Compact Kahler manifolds with partially semi-positive curvature, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13155">with Xi Zhang, arxiv preprint:2504.13155v3</a>. </span> </summary>
<p>
  Our first main result provides a new differential-geometric criterion for rational connectedness. We prove that a compact Kähler manifold is rationally connected if and only if its tangent bundle is BC-*p* positive. 
  This notion of BC-*p* positivity is very weak and arises naturally from a Bochner-type formula associated with MRC fibrations (Proposition 3.3). 
  As a direct application, we confirm a conjecture of Prof. Lei Ni, showing that positive orthogonal Ricci curvature implies rational connectedness.
  Our second result establishes structure theorems for manifolds with semi-positive immediate curvature conditions, offering a natural generalization of several classical works.
<p>
  It would be interesting whether BC-p quasi-positivity (p≥1) imply the rational connectedness and BC-2 quasi-positivity implies the projectivity. 
  The latter is posed by L. Ni. The former is posed by me and indeed implies a conjecture of Xiaokui Yang that quasi-positive uniformly RC-positivity ensures the rational connectedness. 
  I am grateful to Prof. Lei Ni for his attention to this work, and for his generous assistance on numerous other occasions.
<p>
  On a personal note, I must candidly share that the first version of this paper contained an error—specifically, a mistaken equality in a key integral inequality. 
  It was the reviewer’s careful reading that patiently pointed out this issue. 
  In the process of carefully revising those details, I discovered something new and came to a deeper understanding: mathematics is not only about grand visions and directions, but also emerges from meticulous attention to detail. 
  We must take full responsibility for what we write.

  <summary> [3] <span> The Miyaoka-Yau inequality on minimal Kahler spaces, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13365">with Chuanjing Zhang and Xi Zhang, arXiv preprint:2503.13365</a>. </span> </summary>
<p> We extend the classical Miyaoka-Yau inequality to all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces.
  One key is the existence of orbifold modification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273">Ou</a> for klt spaces. 
  This paper does provide a relatively general approach to considering Chern number inequalities and computing HN types of Higgs sheaves on K\"ahler KLT varieties.
  On the other hand, our argument is new for the smooth case. After completing this paper, Iwai shared an alternative approach with me. Please see the paper [5]. 
  That said, the framework developed here—based on L^p approximate Hermitian–Einstein metrics—yields an important byproduct: 
  we obtain the semistability (respectively, generic nefness) of torsion-free sheaves under symmetric powers, exterior powers, and tensor products in the singular setting.
<p>
 Finally, I should acknowledge that the first version of this paper contained an insufficient discussion of Harder–Narasimhan filtrations on singular varieties,
  due to my then-unfamiliarity with certain technical aspects. That exposition was consequently difficult to follow; the present version supersedes it entirely.

  <summary> [2] <span> On the structure of compact Kahler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18779">with Xi Zhang, arXiv preprint:2311.18779v4</a>. </span> </summary>
<p> The main result is the establishment of a "pseudoeffective" version of Bochner-type theorem, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle. The innovation point is an elegant integral inequality.
  This is a key step of the structure theorems of HSC≥0 for the Kahler case obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367">Professor S. Matsumura</a> recently.</p>
<p>
  Concerning the nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature, it remains open whether it implies some minimality in AG?

    <summary> [1] Regularizing property of the twisted conical Kahler-Ricci flow, with with <a href="https://math.njust.edu.cn/43/dd/c17271a345053/page5.htm">Jiawei Liu</a> and Xi Zhang, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08778">arxiv preprint</a>. </summary>
<p> The primary contribution to this work belongs to my collaborators. The most significant guidance throughout my doctoral studies undoubtedly came from my supervisor, yet I wish to express my deepest personal gratitude to my senior, Jiawei Liu. 
  During my difficult third year of PhD, I was grappling with the Kähler-Ricci flow. At that time, Jiawei had already graduated and was conducting his research in Germany. 
  Despite the distance and his own commitments, he offered me patient and consistent guidance through our online correspondence.
  That period culminated in a painful personal realization: that this particular field might not be the right path for me. The sense of frustration and doubt was significant. 
  Yet, looking back, I see that this very struggle—and the generous, remote mentorship he provided across continents—was fundamental. 
  It was through this process that I truly learned how to engage with a research problem, how to question, and how to begin.
</p>
<p>The works [2, 3, 4, 5, 7] form the core of my Ph.D. thesis, completed between September 2023 and January 2026. What follows is a concise version of the acknowledgments from the dissertation.
<p> My deepest thanks go to my supervisor, whose guidance was indispensable, and to my family for their steadfast support throughout this journey. Beyond Jiawei Liu, I am sincerely grateful to many others.
During a particularly difficult period in my third year when I felt stuck, my senior Chuanjing Zhang provided me with invaluable psychological support. 
  I am also thankful to my personal friends—Jiawang Chen, Yirong Hu, Fangyu Peng, Ziqing Tang, and Xuan Zhou—for always being there to listen.
<p> From my fourth year onward, mathematical discussions with other seniors, including Zeng Chen, Di Wu, Changpeng Pan, Kai Tang, Jiaogen Zhang, as well as with friends at USTC such as Tianshu Jiang, brought me both intellectual insight and personal warmth.
During these two years, I was also fortunate to meet and learn from several young Japanese mathematicians, notably Shin-ichi Matsumura and Masataka Iwai, whose thoughtful conversations have greatly aided my research.
