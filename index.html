  I am a fourth-year PhD. student in Mathematics at <a href="http://math.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm">USTC</a>, currently working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xi-Zhang-170">Xi Zhang</a>. I earned my B.S. from USTC in June 2020.
<p>
  My research mainly lies in complex analytic and differential geometry. Recently, I'm interested in vanishing theorems and singular positivity.

<h2>Research Publications</h2>
<p>
  • Compact Kähler manifolds with quasi-positive holomorphic sectional curvature (with X. Zhang). Submitted. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18779v2.pdf">Arxiv link</a>.
<p>
    <blackquote style="color:#888;">
      The main result is establishing an pseudo-effective version of the holonomy principle for compact K\"ahler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature. As applications, we extends Yau's conjecture on positive holomorphic sectional curvature and get the structure theorem of compact simply connected K\"ahler manifold with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature.  We refer the readers to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09153.pdf">"Open problems on structure of positively curved projective varieties"</a> written by S. Matsumura for more related problems.
