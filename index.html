  I am a fifth-year PhD. student in Mathematics at <a href="http://math.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm">USTC</a>, currently working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xi-Zhang-170">Xi Zhang</a>. I earned my B.S. from USTC in June 2020. If everything is OK...I will graduate in next year.
<p>
  My research mainly lies in complex analytic and differential geometry. Recently, I've interested in the geometry of compact Kähler varieties with nef (anti-)canonical bundle.

<h2>Research Publications</h2>

  • On the structure of compact Kähler manifolds with nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature (with X. Zhang), 2311.18779v4. (Submitted)
<p>
    <blackquote style="color:#888;">
      The main result is the establishment of a Bochner-type theorem for nonnegative holomorphic sectional curvature, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle. This is a crucial step towards structure theorems of nonnegative curvature.
