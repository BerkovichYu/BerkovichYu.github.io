<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  My name in Chinese: 张世宇
<p>
  Email: shiyu123@mail.ustc.edu.cn
<p>
  I was born in 1999 in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chengtanjiang,+Liuyang,+Liuyang,+Changsha,+Hunan,+China,+410314/@27.993478,113.7559684,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x34214ab1c9b67ac1:0xe7c8e6847f52ef14!8m2!3d27.99348!4d113.776568!16s%2Fm%2F0wxq_rx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQxNC4xIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D">Chengtanjiang</a>, a peaceful town through which the Nanchuan River (南川河) flows.  
  I usually enjoy reading detective and science fiction novels, as well as watching their adaptations. When I'm alone, my headphones are always with me. I particularly love listening to rock and R&B. Recently, my favorite song is 'Inside Out' by Spoon.
<p>  
  Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I completed my B.S. in June 2020.
  My research primarily focuses on complex geometry, specifically on understanding the geometry of complex analytic spaces.
<p>  
  Recently, I've developed an interest in Mochizuki's work on the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence for parabolic Higgs bundles and try to understand its proof.

<h2 id="Upcoming">Academic events</h2>
<p>
  ——04.21-04.28: I will visit Ningbo university in Zhejiang Province.
<p>
  ——12.01-12.04: I will attend the 31th Symposium on Complex Geometry at Kanazawa, and give a talk. This opportunity was recommended by <a href="https://masataka123.github.io/blog3_e/">Prof. Masataka Iwai.</a>

<h2 id="Seminar">Seminar</h2>
<p>
  • <a href="https://BerkovichYu.github.io/Seminar/Informal discussion in Complex Geometry">Informal discussion in Complex Geometry</a>:
  This is a small complex geometry group that meets once every two weeks, limited to a few young Chinese individuals, and is organized by me, where we discuss specific topics of interest.
  Currently, we are focusing on Parabolic Higgs bundles.
  When we conclude a seminar cycle, usually one cycle lasts a semester, I will reorganize it and invite new members based on the current research interests.

<p>Based on the ideas developed in the previous paper [2], we can establish the structure theorems for partially semi-positive curvature conditions.
  One of the most intriguing implications of this paper is the Hacon-M^ckernan's type question for k-semi-positive Ricci curvature.
  Of independent interests, we confirm a question of Ni that a compact K\"ahler manifolds with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature is rationally connected.</p>

<p> We extend the classical Miyaoka-Yau inequality to all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces.
  One key is the existence of orbifold modification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273">Ou</a> for klt spaces.
  However, our argument also work for compact K\"ahler variety with canonical singularities without Ou's modification, and is indeed new even for the smooth case.</p>

<p> The main result is the establishment of a "pseudoeffective" version of Bochner-type theorem, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle.
  This is a key step of the structure theorems of HSC≥0 for the Kahler case obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367">Professor S. Matsumura</a> recently.</p>
