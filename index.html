<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  My name in Chinese: 张世宇
<p>
  Email: shiyu123@mail.ustc.edu.cn
<p>
  I was born in 1999 in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chengtanjiang,+Liuyang,+Liuyang,+Changsha,+Hunan,+China,+410314/@27.993478,113.7559684,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x34214ab1c9b67ac1:0xe7c8e6847f52ef14!8m2!3d27.99348!4d113.776568!16s%2Fm%2F0wxq_rx?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQxNC4xIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D">Chengtanjiang</a>, a peaceful town through which the Nanchuan River (南川河) flows. Currently, I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Mathematics at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I completed my B.S. in June 2020. My research primarily focuses on complex geometry, specifically on understanding the geometry of complex analytic spaces.

<p>Based on the ideas developed in the previous paper [2], we can establish the structure theorems for partially semi-positive curvature conditions. One of the most intriguing implications of this paper is the Hacon-M^ckernan's type question for k-semi-positive Ricci curvature. Of independent interests, we confirm a question of Ni that a compact K\"ahler manifolds with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature is rationally connected.</p>

<p> We extend the classical Miyaoka-Yau inequality to all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces. One key is the existence of orbifold modification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273">Ou</a> for klt spaces. However, our argument also work for compact K\"ahler variety with canonical singularities without Ou's modification, and is indeed new even for the smooth case.</p>

<p> The main result is the establishment of a "pseudoeffective" version of Bochner-type theorem, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle. This is a key step of the structure theorems of HSC≥0 for the Kahler case obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367">Professor S. Matsumura</a> recently.</p>
