  I will be graduating with a Ph.D. from the University of Science and Technology of China very soon, where I completed my B.S. in June 2020.
<p>
  My research primarily focuses on complex analytic and differential geometry. 
  I only realized six months later that the paper I wrote was quite poorly done. This was because, at the time, even though we had obtained a proof, we didn’t truly understand it, which resulted in the proof not being the most fundamental or concise.
  You might even notice that many people continuously publish papers on very similar problems because, in just one or two years, they gain a deeper understanding.
  However, due to the increasingly fierce competition, we had no choice but to quickly submit it after obtaining some new results.
  My previous research experience was not very mature, and I have already made too many such mistakes. I will do my best to avoid such situations in the future. — 2025/10/13

Recently, I am interested on nonabelian Hodge correspondence for quasi-projective manifolds.

<p>
  In this note, I present an improvement on a result by Chu, Lee, and Tam. Specifically, I prove that a compact Kahler manifold with quasi-negative k-Ricci curvature has ample canonical bundle. I won't submit this note at the moment.
</p> 
<p>
  Furthermore, in the negative case, we can prove that any subvariety of dimension at least k is of general type. I haven't written down this result, becase I cannot address a fundamental open question, which arose from a private communication with Lei Ni, is to construct an example of a compact Kahler manifold X with negative k-Ricci curvature that admits a rational curve (1＜k＜dim X).
  Although such an example was claimed in a paper by Li, Ni, and Zhu, this was in fact a typographical error. If someone find such an example, it will be great because it means that the study on negative k-Ricci curvature indeed provide new perspectives than negative holomorphic sectional curvature.

<p> The main result is establishing the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor.
  The idea of using the non-pluripolar product of <K_X>^{n-2} and providing a proof in the smooth case comes from Iwai and Jinnouchi. 
  When I discussed with Iwai how to extend it to the klt case, I contributed this work. 
  I am always grateful for their kind invitation to collaborate with me.

<p>
  A basic question is characterizing the equality case. It's quite subtle because we used the limiting process.

<p>The first result is providing a new differential geometric criterion for rational connectedness by proving that a compact K\"ahler manifold is rationally connected if and only if its tangent bundle is BC-p positive.
  BC-p positviity is vert weak and naturally arises in a Bochner-type formula associated with MRC fibrations (Proposition 3.3). As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Ni that positive orthogonal Ricci curvature implies the rational connectedness.
  The second result is establishing the structure theorems for semi-positive immediate curvature conditions.
</p>
  <p>
    It would be interesting whether BC-p quasi-positivity (p≥1) imply the rational connectedness and BC-2 quasi-positivity implies the projectivity. The latter is posed by L. Ni. The former is posed by me and indeed implies a conjecture of Xiaokui Yang that quasi-positive uniformly RC-positivity ensures the rational connectedness. 
</p>
  <p>
    I am not sure whether these two questions are true. And it seems to be very difficult by using Bochner techniques.

  <summary> [3] <span> The Miyaoka-Yau inequality on minimal Kahler spaces. (with C. Zhang and X. Zhang) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13365">arXiv preprint:2503.13365</a>. </span> </summary>
<p> We extend the classical Miyaoka-Yau inequality to all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces.
  One key is the existence of orbifold modification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273">Ou</a> for klt spaces. 
  This paper appears to be quite basic, it does provide a relatively general approach to considering Chern number inequalities on K\"ahler KLT varieties, building on more advanced results.
  On the other hand, our argument is new for the smooth case. After completing this paper, Iwai shared an alternative and simplier approach with me. Please see the paper [5].

<p> The main result is the establishment of a "pseudoeffective" version of Bochner-type theorem, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle. The innovation point is an elegant integral inequality.
  This is a key step of the structure theorems of HSC≥0 for the Kahler case obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367">Professor S. Matsumura</a> recently.</p>
