  I will be graduating with a Ph.D. from the University of Science and Technology of China very soon, where I completed my B.S. in June 2020. At present, I am exploring postdoctoral opportunities for the future.
<p>  
  My research primarily focuses on complex geometry. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my research.

  <summary> [5] <span> Miyaoka-Yau inequality for singular varieties with big canonical or anticanonical divisor. (with M. Iwai and S. Jinnouchi) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08522">arxiv preprint:2507.08522</a>. </span> </summary>
<p> The main result is establishing the Miyaoka-Yau inequality for projective klt varieties with big canonical divisor.
  The idea of using the non-pluripolar product of <K_X>^{n-2} and providing a proof in the smooth case comes from Iwai and Jinnouchi. 
  When I discussed with Iwai how to extend it to the klt case, I contributed this work..</p>

<p>Based on the ideas developed in the previous paper [2], we can establish the structure theorems for partially semi-positive curvature conditions.
  One of the most intriguing implications of this paper is the Hacon-M^ckernan's type question for k-semi-positive Ricci curvature.
  Of independent interests, we confirm a question of Ni that a compact K\"ahler manifolds with positive orthogonal Ricci curvature is rationally connected.</p>

<p> We extend the classical Miyaoka-Yau inequality to all minimal K\"ahler klt spaces.
  One key is the existence of orbifold modification by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07273">Ou</a> for klt spaces.
  However, our argument is indeed new even for the smooth case.</p>

<p> The main result is the establishment of a "pseudoeffective" version of Bochner-type theorem, which leads to a splitting of the tangent bundle. The innovation point is an elegant integral inequality.
  This is a key step of the structure theorems of HSC≥0 for the Kahler case obtained by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00367">Professor S. Matsumura</a> recently.</p>
