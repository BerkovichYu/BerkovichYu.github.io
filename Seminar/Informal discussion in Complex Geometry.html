<h1>Informal discussion in Complex Geometry</h1>
<p>
This is an informal and private discussion centered around complex analytic and differential geometry, where we share our discoveries and insights. The goal is to develop and shape our interests and ideas in this field, with a particular focus on the analytic aspects of vector bundles.

 • The existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration and the stability under a neighborhood of the nef class with rational coefficients (张世宇)
<p>
  <blackquote style="color:#888;">
    The proof of Kobayashi's result in the book (p. 161) is incomplete, with a gap addressed in [Bruasse, Harder-Narasimhan filtration on non-Kähler manifolds], where the approach of considering saturated subsheaves as weakly holomorphic maps is adapted. I will provide an alternative proof based on the more algebraic method introduced in [GKPT14, Reflexive differential forms on singular spaces, Appendix], and explain the statement that the stability of HN-filtration in a neighorhood of a nef cohomology class with rational coefficients based on [Cao13, https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4397]. Eventually, I could prove that the existence of (w_1...w_{n-1})-Harder-Narasimhan filtration of torsion free sheaves on normal varities, where w_1,...w_{n-1} are nef classes, estabilish the concept of (w_1,...,w_{n-1})-HN-positivty, and prove a vanishing theorem on normal varities with rational singularities.
