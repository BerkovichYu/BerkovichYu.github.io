<h1>Informal discussion in Complex Geometry</h1>
<p>
This is an informal discussion centered around complex analytic and differential geometry, where we share our discoveries and insights. The goal is to develop and shape our interests and ideas in this field, with a particular focus on the analytic aspects of vector bundles.

 • The existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration and the stability under in a neighborhood of the nef class with rational coefficients
  <blackquote style="color:#888;">
      The proof of the existence of Kobayashi's result in the book is incomplete (see p. 161), a gap that is addressed in [Bruasse, Harder-Narasimhan filtration on non-Kähler manifolds], by adapting the approach of considering saturated subsheaves as weakly holomorphic maps. I will provide an alternative proof, based on the method introduced in [Cao13, https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4397]. The motivation behind this is to explore the existence of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration for reflexive sheaves on normal spaces, and to further develop the concept of HN-positivity for the tangent sheaf.
