<h1>Informal discussion in Complex Geometry</h1>
<hr>
<p>
This is a page recording the informal and private discussion centered around complex analysis and differential geometry, where we share our discoveries and insights. The goal is to develop and shape our interests and ideas in this field, with a particular focus on the analytic aspects of holomorphic vector bundles.

<b> The existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration and the stability under a neighborhood of the nef class with rational coefficients</b> (张世宇)
<p>
  <blackquote>
    Abstract: The proof of Kobayashi's result in his book (p. 161) is incomplete. [Bruasse, Harder-Narasimhan filtration on non-Kähler manifolds] addressed the gap by considering saturated subsheaves as weakly holomorphic maps. I will provide a relatively standard proof based on the more algebraic method introduced in [GKPT14, Reflexive differential forms on singular spaces, Appendix], and explain the statement regarding the stability of HN-filtration in a neighorhood of a nef cohomology class with rational coefficients, based on [Cao13, https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4397]. Eventually, I could prove the existence of (w_1...w_{n-1})-Harder-Narasimhan filtration of torsion free sheaves on normal varities, where w_1,...w_{n-1} are nef classes, estabilish the concept of (w_1,...,w_{n-1})-HN-positivty, and prove a related vanishing theorem on normal varities with rational singularities.
