<h1>Informal discussion in Complex Geometry</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    This is a small complex geometry group that meets once every two weeks, limited to a few young Chinese individuals, where we discuss specific topics of interest, share and check our recent ideas.
<p>
    When we conclude a seminar cycle, usually one cycle lasts at least a semester, the organizers will reorganize it and invite new members based on the current research interests.
<p>
    From 2025/03-2025/08, we are focusing on Parabolic Higgs bundles.

    Abstract: Following my last talk, I will share with you my recent ideas on constructing a singular Hermitian metric on the regular part of 
      a saturated reflexive parabolic sheaf whose curvature form will lead to the parabolic Chern characters.

  <summary> <b style="color:#800000"> Miyaoka-type inequality on minimal K\"ahler maifolds (张世宇) 2025/3/22 </b> </summary>
  <blockquote>
    Abstract: At the the first part, I give a proof for Miyaoka-type inequality for minimal K\"ahler manifolds based on the recent results by Cao, Ou and Paun. This is related to my recent work. At the second part, I give a proof on comparing the semi-stability of two torsion-free sheaves on the resolution of singularities.

  <summary> <b style="color:#800000"> The existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration and the stability under a neighborhood of the nef class with rational coefficients. (张世宇) 2025/1/18 </b> </summary>
  <blockquote>
    Abstract: The proof of Kobayashi's result in his book (p. 161) is incomplete. [Bruasse, Harder-Narasimhan filtration on non-Kähler manifolds] addressed the gap by considering saturated subsheaves as weakly holomorphic maps. I will provide a relatively standard proof based on the more algebraic method introduced in [GKPT14, Reflexive differential forms on singular spaces, Appendix], and explain the statement regarding the stability of HN-filtration in a neighorhood of a nef cohomology class with rational coefficients, based on [Cao13, https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4397]. Eventually, I could prove the existence of (w_1...w_{n-1})-Harder-Narasimhan filtration of torsion free sheaves on normal varities, where w_1,...w_{n-1} are nef classes, estabilish the concept of (w_1,...,w_{n-1})-HN-positivty, and prove a related vanishing theorem on normal varities with rational singularities.
