<h1>Informal discussion in Complex Geometry</h1>
<p>
This is an informal and private discussion centered around complex analytic and differential geometry, where we share our discoveries and insights. The goal is to develop and shape our interests and ideas in this field, with a particular focus on the analytic aspects of vector bundles.

 • The existence of Harder-Narasimhan filtration and the stability under a neighborhood of the nef class with rational coefficients (张世宇)
<p>
  <blackquote style="color:#888;">
    The proof of Kobayashi's result in the book (p. 161) is incomplete, with a gap addressed in [Bruasse, Harder-Narasimhan filtration on non-Kähler manifolds], where the approach of considering saturated subsheaves as weakly holomorphic maps is adapted. I will provide an alternative proof based on the more algebraic method introduced in [Cao13, https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4397], and explain the stability in a neighorhood of a nef cohomology class with rational coefficients. The motivation for this approach is to investigate the existence of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration for reflexive sheaves on normal spaces and to further develop the concept of HN-positivity for the tangent sheaf. However, I have reservations about the proof in Proposition 2.1 of [Cao13], so I am considering to extend Bruasse’s proof to the context of resolutions of singularities in order to establish the existence of the Harder-Narasimhan filtration.
