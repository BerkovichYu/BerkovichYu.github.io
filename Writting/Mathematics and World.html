<h2>Mathematics and World</h2>
Since 2022, in order to achieve something and continue on the path of mathematics, I stopped considering anything outside of it.
I enjoy teaching, reading science fiction, playing table tennis, and admiring a girl far away.
Standing on the edge of a cliff, I felt I could no longer afford to think of anything else.
I have worked hard to become an ordinary mathematician. Mathematics is important, but what has been lost is something far heavier.
<p>
Now, I often ask myself: what is the meaning of the mathematics I’ve spent so much time on? 
Mathematics is a peculiar discipline, and only a small number of people truly advance mathematics that is meaningful to the world. 
My research falls within the realm of complex geometry, but I feel that only a few people in the world are doing truly meaningful mathematics. 
Everyone has different standards for what constitutes meaningful mathematics. My standard is whether the mathematical objects being studied are fundamental, and whether the framework is effective.
Take the Poincaré Conjecture, for instance: a three-dimensional, simply connected, closed manifold is homeomorphic to a sphere. This is naturally a meaningful mathematical problem.
Before Perelman solved the Poincaré Conjecture using Ricci flow, only a handful of people in the world were studying Ricci flow.
Afterward, countless people published research on Ricci flow. I’ve skimmed through most of the literature, but it no longer seems important.
Now, I have a different understanding of why Perelmann distanced himself from the mathematical community.
After solving the Poincaré Conjecture, most mathematics seemed rather dull to him, and the ugly battles over fame and fortune only deepened his distaste.
<p>
As for the papers I’ve written, two of them concern curvature in differential geometry, based on questions posed by influential scholars in the field.
But if you ask me what they’re truly worth, I don’t know. For me, working on these problems brought moments of inspiration, and I felt great joy when writing the paper on holomorphic sectional curvature.
But fundamentally, the greatest impact of these two papers is that one gave me a solid result, and the other was written to fulfill my graduation requirements.
Currently, I am focusing on geometric problems related to models that are central to the minimal model program.
This feels more natural than the curvature problems I considered earlier because these are issues that inevitably arise.
<p>
Regardless, I hope to work on truly fundamental problems that I can wholeheartedly believe in.
I am working towards this direction, but at this moment, the mathematics I’m engaged in doesn’t attract me any more than caring for a cat does.
However, in a sense, mathematics is indeed not everything in life.
